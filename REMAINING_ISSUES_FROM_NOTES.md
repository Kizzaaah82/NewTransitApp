# Remaining Issues from Notes Review

**Date**: October 26, 2024  
**Source**: Technical notes analysis  
**Status**: 📋 To-Do List

---

## ✅ **COMPLETED** (From Option A - Quick Fixes + Route ID Fix)

These 5 issues have been **FIXED**:

1. ✅ **Feed Freshness** - LIVE badges only when data is fresh
2. ✅ **Delay Rounding** - Proper math with `roundToInt()`
3. ✅ **Scheduled Baseline Math** - Fixed with `coerceAtLeast(0)`
4. ✅ **Badge Contrast** - "On time" badge uses neutral colors
5. ✅ **Route ID vs ShortName** - Clear documentation + helper function added

## 🔴 **REMAINING ISSUES** (From Notes)

These are the **remaining 4 issues** identified in the notes that still need attention:

---

### ~~**Issue #4: Route ID vs ShortName Confusion**~~ ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - See `ROUTE_ID_FIX_OCT_26_2024.md`

**What was done**:
- Code was already normalizing correctly (route_id → shortName during parsing)
- Fixed misleading documentation
- Added comprehensive comments explaining normalization strategy
- Added `getRouteShortName()` helper function for safety
- Added logging for debugging

**Result**: Alerts properly normalized, documentation clear, helper function prevents future mistakes.

---

### **Issue #5: Polling Duplication** ⚠️ **MEDIUM**

**What the notes say**:
> You're polling trip updates in **NearbyStops** every 30s via a `while(true)` loop, and in **Home** every 15s—with separate loops. That's double work and can hammer the feed.

**Problem**:
- NearbyStopsScreen polls every 30 seconds
- HomeScreen polls every 15 seconds  
- Two separate polling loops = duplicate API calls
- Battery drain, unnecessary network usage

**Impact**: ⚠️ **MEDIUM** - Battery/network waste, but functional

**Solution**:
- Centralize polling in ViewModel
- Use single StateFlow that all screens collect from
- Exponential backoff on failures (already tracked in Home)

**Files to modify**:
- `NearbyStopsScreen.kt` - Remove polling loop
- `HomeScreen.kt` - Remove polling loop  
- `TransitViewModel.kt` - Centralize polling in one place

**Complexity**: Medium (refactoring required)

---

### **Issue #6: Build-time Hotspots in NearbyStops** ⚠️ **MEDIUM**

**What the notes say**:
> Per-stop route lookup scans `stopsForRoute.entries` and `.any { it.id == stop.id }` for every stop—quadratic on big data.

**Problem**:
- For each nearby stop, code scans all routes
- Uses `.any { it.id == stop.id }` - O(n²) complexity
- Slow with large datasets

**Impact**: ⚠️ **MEDIUM** - Performance issue with many stops/routes

**Solution**:
- Precompute `stopId → List<RouteInfo>` map in `OptimizedTransitData`
- Similar to existing `routeIdToShortName`, `stopIdToBusStop` maps
- One-time computation, fast lookups

**Files to modify**:
- `TransitViewModel.kt` - Add precomputed map to `OptimizedTransitData`
- `NearbyStopsScreen.kt` - Use precomputed map instead of scanning

**Complexity**: Low (add one more precomputed map)

---

### **Issue #7: Favorites Naming Inconsistency** 🟢 **LOW**

**What the notes say**:
> In favorites → arrivals mapping you convert `routeId` to **shortName** for UI (good), but then later elsewhere you also use "routeId" to mean shortName. Keep the naming honest to future you.

**Problem**:
- Field named `routeId` but contains `shortName` value
- Confusing for maintenance
- Not a functional bug, just misleading naming

**Impact**: 🟢 **LOW** - Code clarity issue only

**Solution**:
- Rename variables to reflect actual content
- Use `routeShortName` instead of `routeId` where appropriate
- Add clarifying comments

**Files to review**:
- `HomeScreen.kt` - FavoriteStopWithArrivals rendering
- Any mapping code that converts between route_id and shortName

**Complexity**: Low (cosmetic changes)

---

### **Issue #8: Drawer Alerts Priority** 🟢 **LOW**

**What the notes say**:
> You show the **first** alert's header only. If multiple are active (detour + delays), riders miss critical info; also duplicate/near-duplicate alerts can appear.

**Problem**:
- Only shows first alert header
- Multiple alerts get hidden
- No deduplication of similar alerts
- No priority sorting

**Impact**: 🟢 **LOW** - Users might miss some alerts

**Solution**:
- Sort alerts by priority:
  - DETOUR/NO_SERVICE (highest)
  - SIGNIFICANT_DELAYS
  - STOP_MOVED
  - Others (lowest)
- Deduplicate by `(effect, headerText)`
- Show highest priority + count: "+N more alerts"

**Files to modify**:
- Drawer/navigation UI code
- Alert display logic

**Complexity**: Low (sorting + deduplication)

## 💬 **Questions to Consider**

Before tackling remaining issues:

1. **Route ID issue**: Do you know if your `route_id` and `shortName` differ in your GTFS data?
2. **Polling**: Are you experiencing battery drain issues currently?
3. **Performance**: How many stops/routes does your app handle typically?
4. **Priority**: Which of the remaining issues affects your users most?
