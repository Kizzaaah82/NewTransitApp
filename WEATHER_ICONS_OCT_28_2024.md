# Weather Icon Implementation - October 28, 2024
## What Was Done
Added actual OpenWeatherMap weather icons to the Home Screen weather card, replacing the generic Material Design icons.
## Changes Made
### 1. Added Coil Image Loading Library
**File: gradle/libs.versions.toml**
- Added Coil version: coil = "2.7.0"
- Added library declaration: coil-compose = { group = "io.coil-kt", name = "coil-compose", version.ref = "coil" }
**File: app/build.gradle.kts**
- Added dependency: implementation(libs.coil.compose)
### 2. Updated HomeScreen to Use Actual Weather Icons
**File: app/src/main/java/com/kiz/transitapp/ui/screens/HomeScreen.kt**
**Added import:**
```kotlin
//import coil.compose.AsyncImage
```
**Replaced weather icon display:**
```kotlin
// Before: Material Icon with fixed size 24dp
Icon(
    imageVector = getWeatherIcon(weatherData!!.icon),
    contentDescription = "Weather",
    tint = getWeatherIconColor(weatherData!!.icon),
    modifier = Modifier.size(24.dp)
)
// After: Actual OpenWeatherMap icon with larger size 48dp
AsyncImage(
    model = "https://openweathermap.org/img/wn/${weatherData!!.icon}@2x.png",
    contentDescription = "Weather",
    modifier = Modifier.size(48.dp)
)
```
## Benefits
- More accurate: Shows the actual weather condition icon from OpenWeatherMap
- More detailed: OpenWeatherMap provides specific icons for different weather conditions
- Better looking: Actual weather icons are more visually appealing than generic Material icons
- Larger size: Increased from 24dp to 48dp for better visibility
- Cached: Coil automatically caches the images after first load
## Icon Examples
The weather icons will now show actual weather conditions like:
- Clear sky (day/night variants)
- Few clouds
- Cloudy
- Rain
- Thunderstorm
- Snow
- Mist/fog
Each with day/night variants and different intensities!
## Next Steps
You need to sync the project in Android Studio:
1. Open Android Studio
2. Click "Sync Project with Gradle Files" (the elephant icon with a down arrow in the toolbar)
3. Wait for Gradle to download the Coil library
4. Build and run the app
The Coil library will be automatically downloaded from Maven Central during the Gradle sync.
## What the Old Functions Were
The old getWeatherIcon() and getWeatherIconColor() functions are now unused and can be removed if you want (they are marked as warnings in the IDE). I left them in case you want to keep them as fallback, but they are no longer needed.
## Testing
Once synced and built, check the Home Screen weather card - you should see actual weather icons instead of Material Design icons!
