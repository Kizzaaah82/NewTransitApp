# GitHub Upload Instructions

Your project has been initialized with Git and is ready to be pushed to GitHub! üéâ

## What's Been Done

‚úÖ Git repository initialized
‚úÖ .gitignore file created (to exclude build files and sensitive data)
‚úÖ README.md created with project documentation
‚úÖ All files committed to the 'main' branch

## Next Steps - Push to GitHub

### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `NewTransitApp` (or whatever you prefer)
3. Description: "Modern Android transit app with real-time bus tracking"
4. Choose **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click **Create Repository**

### Step 2: Connect and Push Your Code

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you some commands. You'll want to use the "push an existing repository" option.

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd /home/kiz/AndroidStudioProjects/NewTransitApp

# Add GitHub as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NewTransitApp.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Example:**
If your GitHub username is "kiz123", the command would be:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/kiz123/NewTransitApp.git
```

### Step 3: Enter Your Credentials

When you run `git push`, you'll be asked for credentials:
- **Username**: Your GitHub username
- **Password**: Your GitHub **Personal Access Token** (NOT your regular password)

#### How to Create a Personal Access Token:

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" ‚Üí "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "Transit App Development"
4. Select scopes: Check **repo** (this gives full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **COPY THE TOKEN** - you won't see it again!
7. Use this token as your password when pushing

### Alternative: SSH Setup (Recommended for Frequent Use)

If you prefer SSH (no need to enter token each time):

1. Generate SSH key:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

2. Copy the public key:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```

3. Add it to GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/keys
   - Click "New SSH key"
   - Paste the key and save

4. Then use SSH URL instead:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/NewTransitApp.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Future Updates

After the initial push, making updates is simple:

```bash
cd /home/kiz/AndroidStudioProjects/NewTransitApp

# Make your changes to files...

# Stage the changes
git add .

# Commit with a message
git commit -m "Description of what you changed"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

## Common Git Commands

- `git status` - See what files have changed
- `git log` - View commit history
- `git diff` - See what changed in your files
- `git add <file>` - Stage a specific file
- `git add .` - Stage all changed files
- `git commit -m "message"` - Commit staged changes
- `git push` - Push commits to GitHub
- `git pull` - Pull latest changes from GitHub

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER commit sensitive data:**
- Your `local.properties` file (contains API keys) is already in .gitignore
- Never add passwords, API keys, or private tokens to your code
- The .gitignore file is already configured to protect your sensitive files

üéØ **Your local.properties is safe** - it's excluded from Git and won't be uploaded

## Need Help?

If you run into any issues:
1. Make sure you've created the repository on GitHub first
2. Double-check your username in the remote URL
3. Make sure you're using a Personal Access Token, not your password
4. Check that you're in the correct directory: `/home/kiz/AndroidStudioProjects/NewTransitApp`
